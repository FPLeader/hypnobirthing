            As a mother of 3 lovely children, I have experienced a birth similar to stories you have certainly heard. After I found the HypnoBirthing method and had 2 amazing Hypnobirths, Iâ€™ve experienced a rebirth and growth as a woman and mom. I was amazed by how empowering birth can be, how much a woman can impact her birthing experience with preparation, education and trust in her body and baby, by learning relaxation techniques and creating positive mindset around the miracle of life.
