                                Giving birth is a natural process. Yet a burden of anxiety and fear of birth has been passed from generation to generation across western societies. This has resulted in a modern medical system that is led by fear. Even women who believe that birth is normal and natural often get caught up in the fear based approach. In many cultures, for thousands of years women have supported women through pregnancy and birth. This custom serves to reduce fear and allows women to connect to their bodies and their intuition. In this tradition, we invite you to join us.

                                We currently offer a one day workshop for birth professionals who would like to learn how to support families using HypnoBirthing tools and a 4 day course that prepares you to become a HypnoBirthing educator and teach childbirth education classes. Both are certification trainings which include: in person study, home study, materials, and reviews. The educator training also includes practice teaching and observation.
                                <br /><br />
                                Our trainings combine theoretical concepts with hands-on experiential learning. You will walk away with a large array of tools for relaxation, communication, and knowledge that can help you prepare birthing and postpartum families and support you in nourishing and grounding yourself.
